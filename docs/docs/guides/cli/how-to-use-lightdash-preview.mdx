# Lightdash Preview

**Developer previews** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics, dimensions and charts 
without affecting your production project.

Preview environments will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview environment, so you can test the content 
and also run [validation](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-validate). This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards. 


### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project


```shell
# This will create a preview and will wait until you press a key to delete the preview project
lightdash preview
```

or 

```shell
# This will create a preview and exit, you will have to run lightdash stop-preview to delete it
lightdash start-preview 
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create developer previews, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your 
`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your 
laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.


## Set up developer previews on your pull requests

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to create new dynamic `preview` projects automatically 
when a new `pull request` is created, and it will automatically delete the `preview` project when the `pull request` is closed or merged. 

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

If you haven't already set up a GitHub action for Lightdash, you'll need to add some secrets to GitHub. If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action. 

<GithubSecrets />

### Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu, and click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](./assets/github-actions.png)

Now copy [this start-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/start-preview.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo 

And save by clicking on `Start commit`

Do the same with [this close-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/close-preview.yml).

### You're done! 

Everytime you create a new `pull request` , a new `preview` project with your `branch` name will be created on your organization.
Everytime you make a change to that branch, the preview environment will get updated. 
Once you close or merge your `pull request`, the `preview` project will get deleted. 

You can see the log on `Github actions` page

## How to use the developer credentials in your preview project

When developing in dbt, you typically have a different set of credentials and dataset/schema than when you are running in production.
Here are two options on how to set them up based on the developer that opened the Pull Request.

### Using profile targets

Update your `DBT_PROFILES` to have 1 target per developer. The target name should be their GitHub username.

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: prod
    katie: # example developer 1, should be GitHub username
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_katie
    jose: # example developer 2
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_jose
```

Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the `--target` flag for the `lightdash start-preview` command.

```yaml
run:  lightdash start-preview --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir . --name ${GITHUB_REF##*/} --target ${{ github.actor }}
```

### Using github environments

Setup a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) for each developer where the secrets are specifically for them. The environment name should be their GitHub username.
Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the environment.

```yml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.actor }}
```
